# Overview - Task information:
In this assignment, we were expected to design a “Pokemon game” .
Given a weighted and directed graph - we need to place agents who will catch as many Pokemon as possible efficiently and quickly.



**first algorithm:**\
*there is pokimons on edges in directed wieghted graph.\
*there is agent in some point on the graph.\
*the agent will pick the closet pokimon to him and the most value pokemon by dijkstra algorithm and we do the same with the next pokimon(greedy algorithm).\
*we will call move after eact planning of the travel and when he near picking the pokimon by the agent.

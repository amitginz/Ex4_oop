# Overview - Task information:
In this assignment, we were expected to design a ‚ÄúPokemon game‚Äù .
Given a weighted and directed graph - we need to place agents who will catch as many Pokemon as possible efficiently and quickly.
The goal: to maximize the amount of weights of the Pokemon collected, without exceeding the amount of calls per server allowed per second. To implement this, we used algorithms from the previous task(dealing with graphs).

# the class
1) agent
2) pokemon
3) DiGraph
4) client
5) my_code
6) GraphAlgo
7) test for game

# how run our code:
Download the codes to your Python, including the JAR file and download the JSON files.Run this command in terminal: java -jar Ex4_Server_v0.0.jar 0 (Instead of 0 you can put 
0-15)and then click 'Run' in the my_code file. We're done - now the game will run!!

# Overview - Task information:
In this assignment, we were expected to design a “Pokemon game” .
Given a weighted and directed graph - we need to place agents who will catch as many Pokemon as possible efficiently and quickly.
The goal: to maximize the amount of weights of the Pokemon collected, without exceeding the amount of calls per server allowed per second. To implement this, we used algorithms from the previous task(dealing with graphs).
